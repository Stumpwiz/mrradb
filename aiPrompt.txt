This project generates reports from a MySQL database. It does not use Spring boot; instead is uses
jOOQ middleware. I recently added a "Vacancies" report.  When I run the application from a  run
configuration in the IDE, it generates the vacancies report with the sixteen vacancies in the database correctly.  But when I copy the resulting mrradb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to another directory and invoke it with the Windows shortcut "C:\Program Files\Zulu\zulu-21\bin\javaw.exe" --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-22.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar "C:\Users\Geo\OneDrive\MercyRidge\AdminAssistant\mrradb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar", the vacancies report header appears but the sixteen vacancies are not listed.  All the other three reports (long form roster, short form roster, and expiring terms) are produced correctly both when the application is run from the IDE and when the application is run from the Windows shortcut target.  Can you tell me why this is happening?
